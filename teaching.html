      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
      <p>I design and deliver curriculum and learning experiences for undergraduate students, with a focus on practical, project-based work. I have experience in curriculum design, creating interactive modules, integrating case studies and assessments for both online and in-person modalities, and supervising capstone projects. I am proficient with learning management systems (Canvas) and use them to author course materials, manage assessments, and monitor student progress.</p>
